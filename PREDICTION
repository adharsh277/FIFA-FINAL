      <h1>CAN MESSI WIN THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP</h1>
      <p1
        >Leo Messi lifting the FIFA World Cup Trophy would be a crowning moment
        for the Argentine superstar, and with the form he and Argentina are in
        right now it's very possible. Argentina's most-capped player and
        all-time leading goalscorer is playing in his fifth straight World
        Cup</p1

        >Lionel Messi took home the award in 2014 and is looking to do so again
        in his final World Cup. With the best odds to win the award at only +800
        at FOX Bet, the Argentine superstar is hoping for a lengthy stay in
        Qatar</p1

        Messi's legacy will not be harmed if he fails to win World Cup,

        >Lionel Messi does not need to win a World Cup to cement his legacy,
        says Adlene Guedioura. Seven-time Ballon d'Or winner Messi has landed
        eight league titles and four Champions League trophies during a
        glittering club career But international success with Argentina has
        largely eluded Messi, though he did lift the Copa America last year
        having finished a runner-up three times previously. Messi came close to
        winning the World Cup in 2014, but La Albiceleste suffered final
        heartbreak as Mario Gotze scored an extra-time winner. The 35-year-old's
        failure to bring home international football's top prize has been cited
        by some as harming his legacy in comparison to the likes of Pele and
        compatriot Diego Maradona. The ongoing tournament in Qatar could
        represent Messi's final chance to win the World Cup, with his Argentina
        side set to face the Netherlands in the quarter-finals on Friday.
        Guedioura believes even if Argentina fails in its quest to win a third
        World Cup in Qatar, Messi's legacy will not be tainted. Asked if he
        feels the potential gap in Messi's trophy cabinet will impact how he is
        remembered, the former Algeria midfielder told Stats Perform: "Not at
        all. We've enjoyed him for such a long time with [Cristiano]
        Ronaldo.</p2
